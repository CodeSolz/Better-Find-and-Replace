Easily Search and replace text, code blocks, URLs, footer credits, jQuery / Ajax loaded text or anything in real-time. Search replace within database too..

== Description ==
The plugin offers a seamless solution for efficient database search and replace, complemented by a dynamic real-time word masking feature. 

The real-time option employs a clever word masking technique to search and replace text, url ( anything ), leaving no trace behind. The find and replace process takes place before the website is 
rendered in the browser and does not impact any other files or databases. With this ultimate solution, easily find and replace text, HTML code, media/image URLs, footer credits, 
or any other content within your website without touching the database with the help of an easy-to-use user interface.

On the other hand, the permanent replace ensuring that any replaced text, URL etc is eliminated from your database permanently.
The plugin is equipped with powerful features that allow you to visualize the results of search and replace content within your database as well as permanently erasing it. It has the ability to
search within complex, serialized data structures and replace them with your own words, making it a powerful tool for managing website content for beginners and experienced users alike. 
Additionally, it allows for the removal or un-setting of any element in serialized data by specifying its key.

* **Attention:** Please check the report and make sure which data you are going to replace. It's very important because once you replace it in the Database you can't un-done it.
